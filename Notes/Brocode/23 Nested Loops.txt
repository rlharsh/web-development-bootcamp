Notes:
    Nested loops are loops within loops. They are useful for iterating over data.
    Nested loops are situations where you have a loop inside another loop.

    The example below shows how to draw a grid to the DOM using nested loops.

    let symbol = window.prompt("Enter a symbol to use");
    let rows = window.prompt("Enter the number of rows");
    let cols = window.prompt("Enter the number of cols");

    for (let i = 1; i <= rows; i += 1) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= cols; j += 1) {
            document.getElementById("myGrid").innerHTML += symbol;
        }
        document.getElementById("myGrid").innerHTML += "<br>";
    }

    The above code will ask the user for a symbol, the number of rows, and the
    number of cols. It will then draw a grid to the DOM using the symbol that was
    provided by the user.

Summary:
    Nested loops are loops within loops. They are useful for iterating over
    data structures that are nested, such as lists of lists.
