Type Conversion

Keywords:
Datatype, Change Data, Strings, Numbers, Booleans

Notes:
To convert a string to an integer you can use the Number constructor (as seen below):

    let age = window.prompt("How old are you?"); // Returns a string with the users input
    age = Number(age); // Convert the string into an integer
    age += 1; // Add one to the given input

    console.log("Happy Birthday! You are", age, "years old"); // Print the new age to the console.

To obtain the datatype of a variable we can use the typeof keyword (as seen below):

    console.log(typeof age);
    
Below are the keywords that can be used to convert data into different types:

    Number(input)
        If you attempt to convert something that is not a number such as Number("pizza")
        then it will return NaN which stands for Not a Number.
    String(input)
    Boolean(input)
        Note: with no context passed (ie, "") the boolean will be set to false.
        However, if you type anything within Boolean, such as Boolean("pizza")
        then it will return true.

Summary:
By using data type conversions we can easily convert user input into either Numbers,
Strings or Boolean values so that they can be used within our code.
