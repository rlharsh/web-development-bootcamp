    Do While Loops

Keywords:

Notes:
    A do while loop allows us to execute code prior to checking on the condition.
    Once the code has been ran from within the block the condition is then checked, 
    and if the condition has been met, then the do while loop will exit, otherwise it
    will repeat the code within the block again (see below).

    A do while loop is a variation of the the while loop.

    let userName;
    do {
        userName = window.prompt("Enter your name");
    } while(userName == "")
    console.log("Hello", userName);


Summary:
    Do something, check a condition, repeat if that condition is true.
