Notes:
    To use a for loop you need to know how many times you want to repeat the code.
    You can run a for loop for a certain amount of times or until a certain condition is met (see below).

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        // code to repeat
    }

Summary:
    A for loop will repeat a certain amount of code a certain amount of times.
