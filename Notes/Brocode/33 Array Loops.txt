    Array Loops

Notes:
    -   Array loops are a way to iterate through an array
    -   There are two types of array loops
        -   for loop
        -   for each loop

    The below example shows how to loop through an array using the for loop (see Example 1).

    Example 1:
        let prices = [5, 10, 15, 20];
        for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
            console.log(prices[i]);
        }

    Sometimes you might need to iterate an array in reverse (see Example 2).

    Example 2:
        let prices = [5, 10, 15, 20];
        for (let i = prices.length - 1; i >= 0 - 1; i--) {
            console.log(prices[i]);
        }

    We can also use a standard for loop to iterate through an array of objects (see Example 3).

    Example 3:
        let prices = [5, 10, 15, 20];
        for (let price of prices) {
            console.log(price);
        }

Summary:
    Looping through an array is a common task in JavaScript. There are two types of array loops, the for loop and the for each loop. The for loop is used to iterate
    through an array of values. The for each loop is used to iterate through an array of objects.
