Topic:
    VAR vs. LET

Keywords:
    var, let

Notes:
    - variable scope = where a variable is available/accessible in your code
    - var is function scoped () {}
    - let is block scoped {}

    - global variable = variable declared outside of a function
    - (if global, var will CHANGE browser's window properties)
    - You should never declare a global variable with var

Summary:
    - use let by default
    - var if you need to reassign
    - var if you need to redeclare
