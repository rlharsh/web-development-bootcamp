Notes:
    2D arrays are arrays of arrays. They are useful for storing data in a grid format.
    
    A 2D array is declared like this:
        int[][] array = new int[3][4];
    This creates a 2D array with 3 rows and 4 columns.

    This is a working example of a 2D array (see Example 1).

    Example 1:
        let publisher = [
            ["Marvel", "DC"],
            ["Dark Horse", "Image"],
            ["IDW", "Boom!"]
        ];
        let prices = [
            [3.99, 2.99],
            [2.99, 2.99],
            [3.99, 3.99]
        ];

        let comicList = [publisher, prices];

        console.log(comicList[0][0][0]); // Marvel


Summary:
    A 2D array is an array of arrays, otherwise known as a matrix, or a multidimensional array.
