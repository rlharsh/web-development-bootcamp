Notes:
    Functions are an essential component of JavaScript, as they allow us to write reusable code.
    Arguments can be passed to a function to be used within the function.

    startProgram();

    function startProgram() {
        let userName = "Ronald";
        printUserName(userName);
    }

    function printUserName(userName) {
        console.log(userName);
    }

    Whenever the above code is run, the function startProgram() is called, once it is called
    the userName variable is set to "Ronald", and then the printUserName() function is called,
    and the printUserName function will print the passed argument to the console.


Summary:
    A function is code that can be defined once, and used many times.
    To perform some code, you simple need only call the function name.
