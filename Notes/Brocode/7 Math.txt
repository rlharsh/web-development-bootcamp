Notes:
    To find the rounded value of a number we call on the Math.round function (see below):
        let x = 3.14;
        x = Math.round(x); // x would now become 3 as it has been rounded down

    To find the base value of the next whole number we can use Math.floor (see below):
        let x = 3.14;
        x = Math.floor(x); // x would now become 3 

    To find the ceiling value of the next whole number we can use Math.ceil (see below):
        let x = 3.14;
        x = Math.ceil(x); // x would now become 4

    To find the square root of a number we can use Math.sqrt (see below):
        let x = 3.14;
        x = Math.sqrt(x); // x would now become 1.77200...

    To find the absolute value of a number (the distance to zero) we can use Math.abs (see below):
        let x = -3.14;
        x = Math.abs(x); // x would now become 3.14

    To find the value of a number raised by an exponent we can use the Math.pow (see below):
        let x = 3.14;
        x = Math.pow(x, 2); // x would now become 9.8596, where 2 is by the power we are raising the integer.

    To find the maximum value of a series of numbers we can use Math.max (see below):
        let x = 3.14;
        let y = 5;
        let z = 9;
        let maximum;

        maximum = Math.max(x, y, z); // Would return 9 since its value is the highest.

    To find the minimum value of a series of numbers we can use Math.min (see below):
        let x = 3.14;
        let y = 5;
        let z = 9;
        let minimum;

        minimum = Math.min(x, y, z); // Would return 3.14 since its value is the lowest.

    There are a few built in constants within Math (see below):
        Math.PI is the value for PI

Summary:
    Math is an intrinsic object that provides basic mathematics functionality and constants.
