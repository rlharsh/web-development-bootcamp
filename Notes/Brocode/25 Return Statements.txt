    // Example:
    let area;
    let width;
    let height;

    width = window.prompt("Enter the width of the rectangle:");
    height = window.prompt("Enter the height of the rectangle:");
    area = calculateArea(width, height);

    function calculateArea(width, height) {
        return width * height;
    }

    window.alert("The area of the rectangle is " + area);
