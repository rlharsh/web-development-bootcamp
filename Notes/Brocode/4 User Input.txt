Notes:
The "easiest" method to obtain information is via a prompt, which can be used as:

let username = window.prompt("What's your name?");
console.log(username);

However, the most practical method of obtaining information will typically be in the
form of an interactive element on a page which can be used as follows:

let username;

document.getElementById("myButton").onClick = function() {
    username = document.getElementById("myText").value;
    console.log(username);
}

Summary:
There are several ways to get a users input; you can access this information via
a prompt or by using a textbox in conjunction with a submit button.
