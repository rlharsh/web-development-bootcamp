    Method Chaining

Keywords:


Notes:
    Method chaining makes it easier to combine methods to help to reduce the total number lines of
    code. For instance the below method converts the first character in a variable to uppercase and
    appends the remaining text.

    let userName = "ronald";
    userName = userName.charAt(0).toUpperCase().trim() + userName.slice(1).trim();


Summary:
    Calling one method after another in one continuous line of code.
