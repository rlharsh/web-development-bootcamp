    While Loops

Keywords:

Notes:
    A while loop can be used to repeat code until a certain condition is met (see below).
        let userName = "";

        while (userName == "") {
            userName = window.prompt("Enter in your username");
        }
        console.log("Hello", userName);

        A while loop should always contain a way to break the while loop from within the
        codeblock.


Summary:
    While loops repeat some code while some condition is true (potentially infinite).
