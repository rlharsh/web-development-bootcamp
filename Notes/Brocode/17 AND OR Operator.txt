    AND OR Operators

Keywords:
    AND, OR, && ||

Notes:
    Very useful for finding out if a value falls between a certain range!

    The AND && operator lets us evaluate more than one condition in order to ensure both conditions are met prior to execution
    of code (see below).
        let temp = 50;
        if (temp > 0 && temp < 30) {
            console.log('The weather is good!');
        } else {
            console.log('The weather is bad!');
        }
    In the above example, both conditions must be true before the script executes the call to console.log to inform the user
    that the weather is good!

    The OR || operator lets us evaluate more than than one condition in order to ensure on or the other conditions are met prior
    to execution of code (see below).
        let temp = 20;
        if (temp <= 0 || temp >= 30) {
            console.log("The weather is bad!");
        } else {
            console.log("The weather is good!");
        }


Summary:
    Gives us thew ability to check more than one condition concurrently && AND (BOTH conditions must be true)
    || OR (Either condition can be true).
