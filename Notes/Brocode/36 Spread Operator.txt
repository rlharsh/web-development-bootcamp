Notes:
    A basic working example of an array spread operator can be found below (see Example 1).

    Example 1:
        let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        let maximum = Math.max(...numbers);
        console.log(maximum); // 5

    Another example can be found below (see Example 2).

    Example 2:
        let class1 = ['Bob', 'John', 'Ethan'];
        let class2 = ['Amanda', 'Mary', 'Sally'];

        class1.push(...class2);
        console.log(...class1); // Bob John Ethan Amanda Mary Sally


Summary:
    A spread operator allows an iterable such as an array or string to be expanded in places where
    zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected, or an
    object expression to be expanded in places where zero or more key-value pairs (for object
    literals) are expected.

    It "unpacks" an iterable such as a string or array into its individual values.
