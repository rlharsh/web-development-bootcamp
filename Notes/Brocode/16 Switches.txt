Notes:
    Switches should always be followd by break after a matching operator has been located.
    You should always make use of default as a fallthrough.

    Switches can be used on strings (see below).
        let grade = "A";
        switch (grade) {
            case "A":
                console.log("You did great!");
                break;
            default:
                console.log(grade, "is not an accepted grade.");
                break;
        }

    Switches can be used in conjunction with compare statements (see below).
        let grade = 95;
        switch (true) {
            case grade >= 90:
                console.log("You did great!");
                break;
            default:
                console.log(grade, "is not an accepted grade.");
                break;
        }

Summary:
    A switch is a statement that examines a valuue for a match against many case clauses. 
    A switch is much more effecient than "else if" statements.
