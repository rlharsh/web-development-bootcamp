    Break & Continue Statements

Keywords:
    break, continue

Notes:
    Whenever you use the break statement it will break out of the entire loop (see below).

    // This code will break out of the loop when i = 5
    for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        if (i === 5) break;
        console.log(i);
    }

    Whenever you use the continue statement it will break out of the current iteration of the loop (see below).

    // This code will break out of the current iteration of the loop when i = 5
    for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        if (i === 5) continue;
        console.log(i);
    }


Summary:
    A break statement terminates the loop immediately, the control flow continues with the next statement after the loop.
    A continue statement terminates the current iteration of the loop, the control flow continues with the next iteration of the loop.
