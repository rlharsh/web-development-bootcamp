Notes:
    The Math.random() function will generate a random number between 0 and 1 (using decimals, see below):
        let x = Math.random(); // Can generate a random nuimber between 0 and 1 (ie, 0.4477719)

    To generate a random number between two values we can call the random function like:
        let x = Math.random() * 6; // Will return a random decimal number between 0 and 5.

    To truncate the decimal places we can use Math.floor() to round down like this:
        let x = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6); // Will return a whole number between 0 and 5.

    To add an offset so that we can get 1-6 we can modify the code as such:
        let x = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;

Summary:
    The Math.random function allows us to generate random numbers, and by using offsets we can
    further expand them to start off at a given number whereas the number * of that would be our 
    maximum.
