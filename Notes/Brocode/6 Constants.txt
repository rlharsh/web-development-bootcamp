Constants

Keywords:
const

Notes:
    Constants are variables that cannot be changed, and remain persistant (see below example.)

    const PI = 3.14;    // The value of the const PI cannot be changed.

    A common naming convention for a const is to make all of the letters uppercase (as seen below.)
        const PRICE_POINT = 2.98;
        const TAX_RATE = .0756;

Summary:
    You will want to make use of constants as much as possible for data that you know will not change,
    such as the price of an item, mathmatic formulas, names, etc.

    A constant cannot be changed, and an error will result when attempting to change the value of a 
    constant.
